# Roadmap

Where work stands today (May 2026) and what's queued up next.  Work
is tracked as two parallel streams: the **slice queue** below
(kernel/userspace work units, each one PR) and the GitHub issue
tracker (everything else).  This page is the map between them.

For the chronological log of what's *already shipped*, see
[history](history.md).

## Slice queue

Kernel and userspace work, numbered as focused mergeable units —
usually one PR per slice.

| Slice | Title                                                  | Status                      | Issue                                                                              |

## Active themes

Higher-level groupings that cover several slices and/or issues.

### Userspace + libc

Long-term goal: a self-hosting userspace.  Get a real libc on Makar,
then port `dash` (or extend the in-kernel shell), then bring up TCC
for in-place compile-run.  Detailed plan in
[Userland libc](userland-libc.md).

Open: [#121 — process model & libc](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/Makar/issues/121)
(rolls slice 12's `fork()` work in with musl/uClibc-ng porting).

### Networking

NIC driver → lwIP → DHCP/DNS → simple HTTP/Telnet daemons.

Open:
- [#122 — RTL8139 + lwIP + DHCP/DNS](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/Makar/issues/122)
  — full stack epic.
- [#141 — IP/TCP over NE2000 or virtio-net](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/Makar/issues/141)
  — alternative driver target (NE2000/virtio) for the same stack.

### Makar × Medli interop

Sharing data + binaries with the Medli project.

Open:
- [#138 — COM loader (flat DOS-style binaries)](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/Makar/issues/138)
- [#139 — Serial shell over COM1](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/Makar/issues/139)
- [#140 — MXF executable format (joint binary format)](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/Makar/issues/140)
- [#142 — Login + user accounts (`System\Data\usrinfo.sys`)](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/Makar/issues/142)
- [#143 — INI-style config and data exchange](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/Makar/issues/143)

Background: [Makar × Medli](makar-medli.md).

### Kernel hardening

Things the kernel needs to be properly preemptive + signal-aware.

Shipped (PR #154):
- [#144 — Linux-style signal subsystem](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/Makar/issues/144)
  (slice 8) — per-task handler table, scheduler-driven default-terminate
  delivery, `SYS_KILL(37)` / `SYS_SIGNAL(48)` / `SYS_SIGRETURN(119)`,
  ring-3 trampoline so user-installed handlers actually run, Ctrl+C →
  SIGINT migration (removed `g_sigint` / `keyboard_sigint_consume`),
  `task_t.unkillable` flag protecting idle + shell tasks, `maktop.elf`
  htop-style task viewer with F9 signal picker.
- [#145 — Preemption hardening](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/Makar/issues/145)
  (slice 9) — `in_schedule` re-entrancy guard cleared before
  `task_switch`, `irq_save_disable` / `irq_restore` wrapping the
  critical section, per-task `kticks` accounting in `/proc/tasks`,
  runtime-tunable `g_sched_quantum` (`sched_quantum` shell builtin),
  `test_preempt` busy-loop ktest.

### Filesystem & devices

The on-disk FAT32 layout adopts Medli's canonical structure
(`/Users/`, `/Apps/x86/`, `/System/Data|Logs|Libraries|Modules/`,
`/Temp/` — see [Medli's `Paths.cs`](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/Medli/blob/main/Medli/Common/Paths.cs)
and [Makar × Medli](makar-medli.md)).  Alongside it, the kernel
exposes Unix-style synthetic mounts so userspace tools have a uniform
handle on drivers and devices.

Open:
- [#149 — fdisk/cfdisk-style partition tool](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/Makar/issues/149)
  (interactive create/delete/resize for MBR + GPT; unblocks "install
  Makar onto a blank disk" end-to-end)
- [#150 — `/dev/` synthetic VFS](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/Makar/issues/150)
  (raw block devices `/dev/sdaN`, character devices `/dev/ttyS0` /
  `/dev/tty0`–`/dev/kbd`, plus `/dev/null|zero|random` — pairs with
  `#149`, since `fdisk /dev/sda` reads/writes through this layer)
- [#151 — Adopt Medli-compatible `/Users/` `/Apps/` `/System/` layout](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/Makar/issues/151)
  (migrate today's flat `/apps/` to Medli's canonical FAT32 structure
  from [`Paths.cs`](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/Medli/blob/main/Medli/Common/Paths.cs)
  so user data + binaries move between Makar and Medli without
  translation)
- [#152 — Proper HDD install with GRUB2 (Ubuntu/Arch-style)](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/Makar/issues/152)
  (today's in-kernel `install` is fragile: whole-disk format, copied
  `core.img`, no `grub.cfg` generation, no module verification.  Fix
  it into a real installer — depends on #149/#150/#151)

Already shipped:
- `/proc/` synthetic filesystem with `cpuinfo`/`meminfo`/`tasks`/`uname`
  (#129)
- FAT32 R/W with auto-mount, ISO 9660 (`/cdrom`)

### Display + terminal

Open:
- [#146 — VGA-text fallback per-TTY backing buffers](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/Makar/issues/146)
  (slice 16)
- [#148 — UTF-8 terminal with ASCII fallback](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/Makar/issues/148)
  (slice 13, deferred)

### Shell

Open:
- [#147 — `ps`-style task listing](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/Makar/issues/147)
  (slice 11)

(`serial shell over COM1` lives under the Makar×Medli theme as [#139](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/Makar/issues/139).)

## What's already shipped

See [history](history.md) for the changelog.  Highlights:

- Kernel: paging, heap, scheduler (preemptive 100 Hz), per-task page
  directories, ring-3 lifecycle proven by ktest.
- Storage: FAT32 R/W, ISO 9660, IDE PIO, VFS with auto-mount, synthetic
  `/proc`.
- Userspace: ELF loader, ring-3 `iret`, syscall surface (Linux i386
  subset + Makar extensions 200–215), `makbox` busybox-style
  multicall, apps (`calc`, `vix`, `kbtester`, …).
- Display: VESA framebuffer (720p default), VGA 80×50 fallback, per-TTY
  backing grids, tmux-style status bar, four independent TTYs with
  Alt+F1–F4.
- Tooling: single-entrypoint `run.sh`, ccache toolchain image,
  build-once fan-out CI (4 parallel jobs including a UI-test job).

## Tracking conventions

- **Slices** are kernel/userspace work units numbered in the table
  above.  Each slice should land as one focused PR.
- **Issues** use `feat(<scope>): <topic>` titles for consistency with
  commit messages.  Scopes seen so far: `kernel`, `shell`, `display`,
  `networking`, `makbox`.
- **PRs** reference the issue they close in the body
  (`Closes #N` or `Fixes #N`).  History lives in `docs/history.md`,
  not in PR descriptions — once the PR is merged, the changelog entry
  is the canonical record.
